# Project Title

A Simple Ethereum Token Smart Contract

## Description

This project contains a Solidity smart contract that represents a basic Ethereum token. It allows you to mint and burn tokens, while also keeping track of user balances. This can serve as a foundation for creating custom cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this smart contract, you need to interact with it on the Ethereum blockchain. You can deploy it using tools like Remix or Truffle. Here are some general steps:

1. Download the Solidity source code for the contract.
2. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Remix, Truffle, or a similar development environment.
3. Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallet software, such as MetaMask.

### Executing program

Here are the general steps for interacting with the contract after it's deployed:

1. Mint Tokens:
   - Call the `mint` function, specifying the recipient's address and the number of tokens to create.
   - This function increases the total supply and assigns tokens to the recipient.

2. Burn Tokens:
   - Call the `burn` function, specifying the address and the number of tokens to destroy.
   - This function decreases the total supply and reduces the balance of the specified address.

## Help

If you encounter any common problems or have questions about using this contract, you can refer to Ethereum and Solidity documentation for guidance on deploying and interacting with smart contracts.
